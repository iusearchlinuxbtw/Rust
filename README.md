# Why I did this.
I wanted to help people get into rust, so I write some notes about some of the more important thinks in rust that show you the stuff that you will always need to know.

# How to get started
First, Open up a terminal, or a cmd for windows, Then type in ```git clone https://github.com/iusearchlinuxbtw/Rust.git```. It will download the source for the code. Then you go through all the files, or go to ```main.rs``` and uncomment certant files for output. After that, the only thing left is to run! In your command line, Type ```cargo run```.
